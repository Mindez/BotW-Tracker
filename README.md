# The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild - EmoTracker Pack
It's a pretty straightforward tracker for [MelonSpeedrun's BotW Randomiser](https://github.com/MelonSpeedruns/BotwRandomizer). This tracker will let you keep track of how many Spirit Orbs you have, along with the Paraglider and Master Sword which are both required to beat the game.

## Installation
Clone this repository (or download and extract a ZIP of the repo) into the ``packs`` folder in your EmoTracker installation. This defaults to ``My Documents/EmoTracker/packs``.

At some point I want to get this on the package manager, but that's a future thing.

## Thanks
Big thanks to [AmberCyprian](https://www.twitch.tv/ambercyprian) for showing me that this rando exists, and for all the ideas for my Twitch overlay - honestly that's the big motivation for making this package, so I can have it look nice on stream, so they're the real reason this pack exists.

Oh, and thanks to [StormRiderGaming](https://www.twitch.tv/stormrider) because I just blatantly took [their EmoTracker package](https://github.com/StormRiderGaming/emotracker-pokemon-red-blue-key-item) and changed enough of the words that I made it look like I didn't just copy their homework.

Big thanks to [EmoSaru](https://twitch.tv/emosaru) for making EmoTracker in the first place!

And of course, thanks to [MelonSpeedruns](https://www.twitch.tv/melonspeedruns) for making the randomiser.

## TODO

I'd love to make this an all-purpose tracker for Breath of the Wild, so it'd be great to have a map to keep track of how many chests are in an area, as well as supporting the other Breath of the Wild randomisers. I don't have a feature list planned out, but watch this space.
